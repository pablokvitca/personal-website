Welcome to my new personal website!

## Why a New Website?

I've been wanting to rebuild my personal website from scratch for a while. This time, I wanted to:

1. **Use modern web technologies** - Astro with React islands for the best of both worlds
2. **Focus on content** - MDX for rich, interactive blog posts
3. **Type safety** - TypeScript throughout the entire codebase
4. **Great developer experience** - Fast builds, hot reload, and great tooling

## The Tech Stack

This site is built with:

- **Astro** - A modern static site generator with islands architecture
- **React** - For interactive components
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **MDX** - Markdown with JSX components

## What's Next?

I plan to write about:

- **Machine Learning** - Exploring ML algorithms, models, and applications
- **Artificial Intelligence** - Deep dives into AI systems, architectures, and breakthroughs
- **AI Agents** - How autonomous agents work, their capabilities, and real-world applications
- **AI Safety** - The critical importance of building safe, reliable, and ethical AI systems
- **AI in Daily Life** - How AI is transforming our everyday experiences and interactions
- **AI in Companies** - How businesses are leveraging AI to drive innovation and efficiency
- **AI in the Technology Industry** - The role of AI in shaping software development and tech infrastructure
- **AI in the AI/ML Community** - How AI tools are being used to build better AI systems (meta-AI)

I'm particularly interested in the intersection of AI and software engineering, and how we can build better tools and systems that leverage the power of machine learning while maintaining safety, transparency, and human agency.

Stay tuned for more content!
