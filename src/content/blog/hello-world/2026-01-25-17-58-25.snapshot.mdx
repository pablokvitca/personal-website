Welcome to my new personal website!

## Why a New Website?

I've been wanting to rebuild my personal website from scratch for a while. This time, I wanted to:

1. **Use modern web technologies** - Astro with React islands for the best of both worlds
2. **Focus on content** - MDX for rich, interactive blog posts
3. **Type safety** - TypeScript throughout the entire codebase
4. **Great developer experience** - Fast builds, hot reload, and great tooling

## The Tech Stack

This site is built with:

- **Astro** - A modern static site generator with islands architecture
- **React** - For interactive components
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **MDX** - Markdown with JSX components

## What's Next?

I plan to write about:

- Software development
- Technology trends
- Projects I'm working on
- Lessons learned

Stay tuned for more content!
